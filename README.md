# Web-Scrapping 
#### It is the process of extracting data from websites using code. It allows you to gather information from webpages by downloading the HTML content and parsing it to extract the desired data.
#### Python offers several libraries to help with web scraping, the most popular ones being:
 Requests: Used to send HTTP requests to retrieve the HTML content of a webpage.<br/><br/>
 BeautifulSoup: A library for parsing HTML or XML content and navigating the structure to extract useful information.<br/><br/>
 Selenium: Often used for scraping dynamic content, where JavaScript is involved in rendering data.<br/><br/>
 lxml: A library that is also used for parsing HTML and XML content, known for its performance and ease of use.

#### Basic Steps for Web Scraping:
  1). Send a Request to the Website: Use requests or Selenium to retrieve the HTML page.<br/><br/>
  2). Parse the HTML: Use BeautifulSoup or lxml to parse the page.<br/><br/>
  3). Extract the Data: Find the specific elements on the page using HTML tags, classes, or IDs, and extract the data.<br/><br/>
  4). Save the Data: Store the scraped data in a file, such as CSV, or a database.

#### Example with BeautifulSoup and requests:
